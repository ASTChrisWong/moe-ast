<p>
The NFS Chapter works closely with Curriculum Planning and Development Division and other related educational agencies to extend learning in Nutrition and Food Science.  Through collaboration and networking, it harnesses synergy among Nutrition and Food Science teachers in schools, MOE Divisions and institutions of higher education to work towards improved student outcomes.<br><br>

Through collaborative learning in the NFS professional network, teachers could broaden their professional knowledge and improve their practices. There will be opportunities to obtain updates on curriculum and pedagogy, and to share ideas and resources with fellow teachers in the NFS fraternity.<br><br>

<b>We organise various professional learning activities for you:</b> <br><br>

•   Courses and learning programmes<br>
•   Learning journeys<br>
•   Professional conversations with overseas and local educators<br>
•   Networked learning sessions e.g. ST-LT network<br>
•   Professional learning sessions for BTs

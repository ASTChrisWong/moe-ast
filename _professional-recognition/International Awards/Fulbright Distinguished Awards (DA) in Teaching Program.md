The DA Program is one of the flagship international educational exchange programs supported by the U.S. government. It brings outstanding international educators to the United States (U.S.) for a semester-long program to pursue individual or group projects, take courses for professional development at a U.S. host university, and observe and share their expertise with U.S. colleagues.

The DA Program has provided our educators with good exposure and understanding of teaching and learning practices in overseas institutions and schools, and has allowed them to more deeply appreciate the strengths and areas of relative weakness of our education system as they engage in professional networked learning and dialogue with educators from the U.S. and from other participating countries.

_Participating countries/region :_

_Bangladesh • Botswana • Brazil • Finland • Greece • India • Indonesia • Israel • Kenya • Mexico_ _•_ _Morocco • New Zealand • Philippines • Senegal • Singapore • Taiwan • Uganda • United Kingdom_

Educators who return from the DA Program in the U.S. will share their learning at national platforms like the Teachers’ Conference, and will get to work with the related Master Teachers to explore how their learning can be extended to the teaching fraternity.  In years when there is no Teachers’ Conference, AST organises an Inquiry Project Sharing session during which the DA recipients come together to engage in professional dialogue with our teachers on the implications of the learning from the DA Program against our local educational context.

<b> Sharing our similarities, celebrating our differences</b><br><br>Miss Angelynna Lim<br><br>In August 2017, as part of the Fulbright Distinguished Awards in Teaching Program, I first set foot in Bloomington, Indiana, knowing the city only by its reputation of being a university town. Over the course of the four months that I was there, I developed an affinity for the city and its people and affectionately called the place ‘home’. What struck me most about the Midwesterners was their extremely warm, kind, and down-to-earth nature. They were generally friendly with willing smiles and would even wave at strangers. Once, I was standing at the traffic junction wondering about my bearing and feeling a little lost. A passer-by automatically stopped to offer help. At the supermarket, the cashier would always greet customers with a smile and ask how the day was. When taking the public transport, be sure to shout out a “thank you!” to the driver, and be ready to receive a cheerful “Have a great day ahead!” response. In our hectic lives, we sometimes underestimate the power of these little gestures which would make someone’s day. For those treasured four months, I learnt to truly value and appreciate how these intricacies added “an extra layer of human touch” to our daily interactions with others.<br><br>Another characteristic of the Midwesterners is how they are community-minded. There is an incredibly strong community spirit where people enjoy spending time bonding with family and friends. Many of them identify strongly with specific communities which they belong to. Getting together for the 3Fs: Food, Fun and Festivities was commonplace. This is akin to Singapore’s ‘kampung spirit’, where there is a sense of social cohesion in a community, and where diversity is appreciated and respected. With the warm hospitality of my Bloomington hosts, there was no lack of community activities for me to participate in. Some of the more memorable activities include a picnic-cum-nature hike at McCormick’s Creek State Park, and a pumpkin-picking project where the pumpkins were picked and sold to raise money to build houses for under-privileged families in Mexico.<br><br><img src="/images/prore28.png" style="width:35%"><figcaption> <i>Pumpkin-picking for a Worthy Cause</i></figcaption><br><br> <b> Application of Learning <br><br> “To learn and not to do is really not to learn. To know and not to do is really not to know.”<br>~ Stephen R.Covey</b><br><br>The purpose of my inquiry project was to look at some of the best classroom practices in the United States, particularly those strategies and teaching actions that help students strengthen their reasoning and communication process skills.<br><br>Throughout the semester at Indiana University, I audited two courses. One of them examined modern cognitive theories of knowing, learning, and transferring; and the implications on teaching, motivating, assessing, and evaluating. The weekly readings and discussions gave me an in-depth view on the theoretical underpinnings of how learners learn and develop enduring understanding. This helped me better appreciate the evolution of the mathematics curricula over the years. The other course I audited opened more doors for me as the professor kindly invited me to participate in a professional development project for K-6 mathematics teachers in Owen and Monroe county. At the PD sessions, I was introduced to the book 5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematics Discussions, which identifies a set of teaching actions for teachers to achieve learning objectives by using student work as the launchpad for discussions. In the discussions, important mathematical ideas are surfaced for understanding to be developed or consolidated.<br><br>Besides the courses at Indiana University, I had the privilege of attending the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) regional conference in Orlando. The conference was an excellent platform to network and to exchange ideas with fellow mathematics educators as I learnt the best practices for engaging students and for driving student achievement. Post-conference, the conversations still continue as I am now a proud member of the online NCTM community of like-minded researchers, teachers, parents, and individuals who are deeply passionate about mathematics and mathematics education.<br><br><img src="/images/prore29.png" style="width:40%"><br><br>
	
<i>Professional Development: NCTM Regional Conference in Orlando</i>  <br><br>

As a culmination of my learning, I adapted some of the unit and lesson planning structures to guide teachers through planning lessons which focus on developing understanding. A sample unit package, complete with lesson resources, was put together to suggest ways in which the strategies outlined in Visible Thinking and from the “5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematics Discussions” could be interwoven into the lessons to complement the existing curriculum materials. Coupled with the use of mathematics discourse cards, the package is ready to be shared and tried out with our Singaporean students. Future plans include the refinement of the package based on feedback from teachers.<br><br>

<b>School, a place for dedicated teachers to inspire and to teach individuals, not the curriculum</b><br><br>

  
One of the things that struck me most about the United States education system is the strong influence of the core American values of individualism and equality.  Driven by the strong belief that each child is unique, significant emphasis and value are placed on individual initiative, independence and individual expression.  This was clearly evident in the schools which I visited. One public school offers flexible ability grouping in mathematics for all 4th to 6th Grade students, allowing students to take the subject at a different grade levels based on their progress and learning needs. Another private school offers an inter-grade level differentiated grouping where teachers state the expectations and requirements of the classes, and students assess and reflect upon their own abilities before making their own choices on the class they would like to join. There are countless merits in tailoring teaching to the students’ needs. In order for this to work effectively, a few factors require careful consideration: teachers’ understanding of individual students’ needs, students’ self-awareness, and the knowledge of “what’s next” after grouping the students according to their needs.<br><br>

  
A major highlight of my school experiences would be the visits to two Project Zero- based schools, both with long-standing histories implementing Visible Thinking as a school-wide framework for learning. It was impressive seeing the artefacts of the student’s work and hearing how articulate they were in expressing their opinions and defending their points of view with sound arguments, regardless of their age. The lesson observations provided me with some practical ideas of how visible thinking strategies could be interwoven into the mathematics classroom. This reaffirmed my perspective of education: that we should never underestimate the potential of our students and teachers when they are given the trust, faith and accountability to succeed. Nonetheless, I am also mindful that with all implementations, in order to bring change in the teaching practices, teachers’ buy-in and ownership is key.<br><br>

<i><b>The Fulbright experience, a once in lifetime opportunity</b></i><br><br><img src="/images/prore30.png" style="width:80%"><br><br>My Fulbright experience has impacted me in more ways than I could ever imagine, both personally and professionally. It was a unique blend of exciting learning experiences with quiet reflective time on an amazing journey of self-discovery.<br><br>

  
On a personal level, developing friendships across perceived cultural boundaries is a skill which I picked up during the program. What better way to learn more about different cultures and countries than to live together as a Fulbright community “under one roof”? Bonding over tea, celebrating one another’s festivities, and appreciating cultural differences were just subtle ways in which we fulfilled the Fulbright program’s vision of promoting mutual understanding. Hearing the stories from other Fulbrighters helped me better appreciate what I have back home. Even as we return to our home countries, I am sure that we would still continue to keep in touch. In fact, plans to visit one another are already in the pipeline, and I look forward to travelling and meeting with my international friends.<br><br>

  
Professionally, I have undergone the three different stages of unlearning, learning and re-learning. I had to keep an open mind to let go of preconceived ideas to broaden my learning. In the process of unlearning, I frequently found myself examining my current teaching practices, and questioning what I hoped to accomplish with my project to improve teaching practices back home. With insightful readings and rich conversations with my advisor, faculty members, and other teachers, I embarked on the learning stage, which led to further questioning and reflections. At times, toggling between learning and unlearning, and re-examining practices led me to feel frustrated. Nonetheless, the re-learning process will continue even as the Fulbright program has concluded, and as I share what I have learnt with fellow Singapore teachers.<br><br>

   
In summary, the essence of my Fulbright experience lies in having the great privilege to take a step back from the hustle and bustle of everyday school life to reflect and to ask questions about what we do not know.<br><br>
	
<b> My Fulbright Experience</b><br><br>
	
Mr Edwin Chew<br><br>

My Fulbright Experience started when award recipients were asked to participate in an online course with two course administrators.  The course provided a comprehensive introduction to cultural exchanges, the American lifestyle, and life in Indiana University.  The opportunity to work, and interact, with 18 international teachers from 8 different countries (Finland, India, Israel, Morocco, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and Taiwan) was one of the key highlights as it was reminiscent of being back in varsity. It was a memorable experience as we cooked our own home cuisines, shared our culturally unique recipes, and savoured delicacies. I especially enjoyed the times when we would share our life stories, and was moved by the personal accounts of life back in their home countries.<br><br>

  
I gained a rich learning experience from the school visits, auditing courses at Indiana University, and having professional conversations with teachers, lecturers and students.  To me, the cross-cultural experience, which is the intent of this Fulbright experience, was indeed the icing on the cake.  This invaluable experience is the best gift bestowed to me, as an individual, and as a teacher.	<br><br>

I enjoyed the many interactions with fellow educators whom I met through presentations, and other academic and social meet-ups. Through the conversations, I was exposed to the American culture, be it through food, hobbies or sports. For recreation, I participated in activities with the locals such as golfing and drumming. I must express my appreciation to Jacob Butler (course administrator) for being most helpful; to past and present Fulbrighters like Alex (2016), Kate (2017), Martha (2016), David (2015), and Nathan (2017) for their warm welcome and generosity; and to the teachers who have since become close friends: Susan and Steven. <br><br>

  
The various cultural exchanges gave me new insights. I was able to learn more about what it means to be a teacher in different international and cultural contexts, often over cosy home-cooked meals which we took turns to prepare. The 17 other Fulbrighters and I shared our aims and inspirations, and the challenges we faced in our professional practice. I found it fulfilling and rewarding to be exposed to educational issues all over the world in these rich, meaningful interactions.<br><br>

<b>Professional Development</b><br><br>
I conducted a fieldwork session through an environmental sciences lesson fieldwork organised by Bloomington High School, and was able to interact with students. It was a challenge to officially take students out and to talk to them about geography education as there are stark differences between our curricula.  What I really enjoyed that day was teaching them how to observe the environment and doing field sketches with them. The sketches produced were of high quality, and I was very pleased with their performance.	<br><br>
	
	
<img src="/images/prore33.png" style="width:50%">	<br><br><i>Environmental Sciences Fieldtrip on 4 October 2017</i><br><br>Aside from the official platforms in school to develop professionally, I found that collaboration with and the sharing of best practices by staff and other Fulbrighters at various presentation platforms have also moulded me professionally. I was also moved by the Fulbright Alumni who got in touch with me and invited me to visit their schools. Through working with students and engaging them in conversations about life, and about the learning and teaching of geography, I gained a deeper insight into teaching and learning in the US.<br><br>

  
A total of 12 school visits (5 in Indiana, 3 in Chicago, 1 in San Francisco, 3 in Seattle) were successfully completed from August to November 2017. I visited a specific school eight times in Indiana which gave me opportunities to conduct an in-depth study, and to engage in deep discussions on educational and policy issues. I noticed that for all teachers, students are central and their main concern is for the child. The love and concern for them is a constant reminder of my job as a teacher and as an individual. The saddest point during the four-month attachment was when the inner-city students spoke to me about what safety meant to them.  To them, school is a safe haven. When I highlighted that Singaporeans can be out in the streets at any time of the day, they were stunned.  I was overwhelmed when they told me how “unsafe” certain places were, even their own homes.  After the conversations, the teachers and students approached me and gave me a hug.  I felt moved, and was grateful for being in Singapore where we live peacefully together without having to constantly worry about physical safety.<br><br>

  
It was indeed enriching working with the American teachers teaching social studies and discussing with them the importance of fieldwork in enhancing students’ learning.  I also learnt how literacy was taught and woven into the classrooms as teachers gave explicit examples on suggested strategies.  Framing my inquiry within the field of disciplinary literacy was helpful in achieving this aim. The particular skills required from students as they embarked on geography fieldwork are not dissimilar to the cognitive approaches required in science. As such, supporting students to progress within the specific literacy demands of the subject offers both a challenging and an interesting perspective.  My main takeaway was that I should provide more scaffolding when working with less academically-inclined students. Previously I would assume that my students would be able to complete the assigned task with my teaching resources and instructional strategies. I only realised the difficulties they face in understanding the questions and in crafting the answers when I am in class and have conversations with them. Moreover, in the schools I observed, teachers mostly focused on content without the explicit teaching of literacy. The worksheets used were provided a good amount of scaffolding on processes, as compared to the content-heavy worksheets used in most Singapore schools.<br><br>

  
Students who needed additional help in grasping English may be reassigned to another class, one that is supported by a native speaker. For instance, mathematics is taught in English by a mathematics teacher with an accompanying Spanish teacher who translates the lesson. Printed notes and PowerPoint slides tend not to be given in copious amounts, so students make their own notes or write their own reflections. They also record salient points using templates prepared by the teachers to aid them in their thinking and learning.<br><br>

  
Attending social studies conferences both in Indiana and San Francisco (National Council of Social Studies 2017) provided me with an excellent opportunity to share my work on citizenship and values in Singapore with the teachers, and to learn best practices from them.  I found the sharing sessions particularly motivating and useful as I learnt about the cognitive process behind the creation of the lesson plans, and also gained insights on Assessment, Pedagogy and Curriculum as experienced by practitioners.<br><br>

<i>Participating in the National Council of Social Studies Annual Conference at San Francisco from 15-19 November 2017</i><br><br>

Through the conference and professional conversations with the teachers and students, and the classes I audited at Indiana University, I redefined my inquiry project on how fieldwork could be taught to my Normal (Academic) students. I realised how my teaching in the class could be improved and how to provide more scaffolding to encourage my students to think and to write in the fieldwork domain. I am excited to share my learning and these approaches through hands-on sharing and workshop sessions with my fellow colleagues back in Singapore.<br><br>

<b>Personal Growth</b> <br><br>
What then, is this Fulbright experience? It is definitely not the inquiry project alone, but the many meaningful interactions with fellow teaching practitioners from around the world.  This experience is beyond written words. I am thankful and grateful for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.	<Br><br>
	
<b>The Fulbright Distinguished Award in Teaching Programme</b><Br><br>Miss Rebecca Kong<br><br>Being on the Fulbright Distinguished Award in Teaching Programme has given me an opportunity to step away from the busy-ness of school to critically reflect on my own teaching philosophy and teaching practices, and to grow myself both personally and professionally. I am thankful for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that not many teachers get, to go overseas to learn from, and with, educators from all over the world. The time spent in the US visiting schools, and engaging in dialogues and discussions with fellow educators from all around the world has given me a newfound perspective on global educational issues and challenged my own beliefs of how science should be taught in the classroom.<br><br>

<b>Growing Personally as an Individual</b><br>
Living and working with the Fulbright teachers has made me more culturally aware and sensitive, to become more appreciative of cultural differences and diversity. One thing that really struck me was the fact that food binds everyone together, regardless of which part of the world we are from. Coming from Singapore, where social functions centre around food, I realised that dining in social gatherings cuts across many cultures all over the world. Having many cultures under one roof meant we had ample opportunities to bond over food. All of us, including the Singaporean Fulbrighters, had regular food gatherings where we shared our own local food and stories,  and learned and appreciated one another’s cultural practices.  The many regular cultural events on campus also enhanced my appreciation for the diversity of cultures present within the US.<br><br>

One of the most memorable events that took place at Indiana University was the solar eclipse on 22 August 2017. It was amazing to see thousands of students on campus converge to watch the solar eclipse. There was a carnival-like atmosphere with booths set up by students and professors to educate and to engage everyone about the eclipse. Being in Indiana, I was fortunate to witness 94.1% of the sun covered by the moon—almost a total eclipse. It was awe-inspiring and another reminder that science is all around us and very much a part of our lives.		<br><br>
	
<img src="/images/prore36.png" style="width:30%">	<br><br>
	
While in the US, I had the opportunity to interact with the locals and to experience Halloween in America where children and adults dress up in costumes and go trick-or-treating. We see this in the movies and hear about it, but nothing beats experiencing it in person and soaking in the festivities. It was really exciting. What really surprised me was seeing how resourceful and creative people were in designing their costumes. They were not the typical bought-off-the-shelf costumes, but rather, the costumes were put together with everyday materials found around the house.<br><br>

<b>Growing Professionally</b> <br> 
Many experiences during my Fulbright stint contributed to my professional growth as a teacher. A highlight of my experience in the Fulbright Program is the six-week attachment to a high school. I had to visit the school once a week to observe classroom lessons for a day while attached to a host teacher. During my attachment, I was able to see how authentic learning could better motivate and engage learners. Observing the different teaching methods by different teachers allowed me to compare the way science is taught in the US and in Singapore. I was able to witness good practices and how they were carried out in varying degrees of success, depending on the different classroom contexts, which led me to reflect on how I could improve my own teaching practices. I also had the opportunity to work with my host teacher to craft a unit and to teach one of the lessons. It was indeed an enriching experience as I had to understand the US educational context and adjust my style of teaching to accommodate the different profile of the local students.<br><br>

  
As I worked on my inquiry project, I was able to probe and to deepen my own understanding of how students learn science and what inquiry in science really means. My in-depth discussions with teacher educators across the US, and interactions with educators during seminars and workshops have equipped me with new understanding of how inquiry should look in my classroom. It has led me to question my own teaching practices and beliefs, challenging me to use new pedagogies and strategies to engage the learners in my classroom more effectively and to pursue making their thinking visible. I was able to explore different strategies to elicit and to access students’ thinking, so that I could tailor my lessons to better meet the needs of my students, which is an essential component of a learner-centred education.<br><br>

<b>Conclusion</b><br> 
I have been privileged to have learnt so much, both professionally and personally, through my Fulbright attachment in the US.  The friendships forged with fellow Fulbright educators from all over the world are a reminder to me that despite the differences in nationality, race, and religion, we have one thing in common: the desire to improve teaching and learning and to become better teachers for our students. The Fulbright programme might have ended, and it will be but one of the many journeys I will embark on in my quest to grow professionally to become a better teacher.

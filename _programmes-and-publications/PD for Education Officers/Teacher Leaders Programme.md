### Teacher Leaders Programme
 

The Teacher Leaders Programme (TLP) is a suite of three milestone programmes that are designed by the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST), in collaboration with the National Institute of Education (NIE). Each TLP aims to support the growth of officially appointed Teacher Leaders, and helps them work towards achieving the key result areas aligned to their specific roles.

The learning experiences in these milestone programmes shape the professional disposition of the Teacher Leaders and strengthen the skills and knowledge towards the fulfilment of the five desired teacher outcomes of the Teacher Growth Model (TGM):

*   The Ethical Educator
*   The Competent Professional
*   The Collaborative Learner
*   The Transformational Leader
*   The Community Builder

This programme seeks to prepare Teacher Leaders for their roles as pedagogical leaders and instructional mentors to others. Each programme focuses on creating a variety of purposeful learning experiences that inspire new ways of teaching and learning.  These experiences are built upon the firm foundation of holistic education and core beliefs as reflected in the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP).

The modules in the milestone programmes reflect the expected scope of impact and influence of Teacher Leaders.  Close referencing is made to the ethos of the teaching profession and participants’ roles as pedagogical leaders and instructional mentors in the fraternity.

The programme aims to enable Senior Teacher participants to <br><br>

•  develop a shared understanding of the core beliefs and the role of STs in bringing out the full potential of their students;<br>
•  build their capacity to lead and facilitate teams, manage working relationships, and foster a collaborative professional culture in their schools; and<br>
•  keep up-to-date with current issues, trends, and developments in curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment and to enable STs to contribute innovatively in teaching and learning.<br><br>

<u>Programme Description</u>

Senior Teacher participants will acquire and apply key knowledge and skills to impact the teaching community within the school. The modules address topics such as curriculum leadership, coaching and mentoring, teacher leadership, assessment literacy, professional ethics, and community engagement.  To further enhance Senior Teachers’ grounding in research methodology and skills, there is a research component where Senior Teachers design and implement a school-based research project (Capstone Project).

Within six months after the programme, Senior Teacher participants will pilot their team research project (Capstone Project) before presenting the outcomes and evaluation of the implementation of this project to NIE and their peers.

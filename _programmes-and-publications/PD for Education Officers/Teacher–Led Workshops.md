#### Rationale of Teacher-Led Workshops

Teacher-Led Workshops (TLWs) are conducted by teachers for teachers. Guided by the mission of the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) to develop a teacher-led culture of professional excellence, AST has built on the work of Teachers’ Network to create opportunities for teachers to lead and inspire through the sharing of good practices. Through this platform, teachers will engage in professional exchange of pedagogical content knowledge, leading to enhanced pedagogical practice.

### Mr Francesco Paul Neal-Noschese (2023)

##### AST’s 31st Outstanding Educator-in-Consultancy (OEIC) Programme

Mr Francesco Paul Neal-Noschese (Frank Noschese) is a New York State Master Teacher Emeritus and is passionate in leading students construct their own understanding of science concepts. With over 24 years of experience in the teaching of Physics in John Jay High School, he was a recipient of the Paul W. Zitzewitz Excellence in K-12 Teaching Award from the American Association of Physics Teachers in 2018 as well as the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching in 2011.  

Prior to his engagement as the Outstanding Educator for AST’s OEIC (from 10 April to 21 April 2023), Mr Noschese collaborated closely with our Master Teacher/Physics, Mr Jensen Ong, in co-designing and co-developing engagements for our educators. These discussions rich and delved deep into pedagogical practices associated with inquiry-based learning, and how the local contexts can be considered for the application of teaching strategies. Mr Noschese also collaborated with our local Teacher Collaborator, Mr Lawrence Tang (Lead Teacher/Physics, Zhonghua Secondary School), to apply his strategies in inquiry-based learning to enhance the learning of the concept of stability in a Secondary Three classroom in Zhonghua Secondary School.

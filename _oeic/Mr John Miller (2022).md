### Mr John Miller (2022)

#### AST’s 29th OEIC/R

Mr John Miller is a recipient of the American Fulbright Distinguished Awards in Teaching and a finalist for the 2017 California Teacher of the Year. Having 28 years of teaching experience, he is passionate about working with underperforming and economically disadvantaged students through the innovative uses of educational technology to promote literacy and the social sciences. His research interests include how games and game mechanics can be used to address curricular needs across the content areas. He is also a Google Innovator, a curriculum designer for Microsoft and a recognised Minecraft trainer.

During his engagement as AST’s 29th OEIC/R Outstanding Educator, Mr Miller participated in rich dialogues with our Master Teacher supporting the programme, Mr Lloyd Yeo, who lent his subject matter expertise and pedagogical experience to further contextualise the strategies shared by Mr Miller for the local educators. Apart from conducting the three-part workshop and presenting at the OEIC symposium, Mr Miller had also collaborated with two local Teacher Collaborators, Ms Rachel Ong (Lead Teacher/History, Broadrick Secondary School) and Ms Chong Yoke Khee (Lead Teacher/History, Kent Ridge Secondary School), to apply these strategies in their history classrooms.

<b><u>Overview of Workshop</u></b>

Mr Miller’s blended learning workshop titled ‘Differentiation in the History Classroom: Lesson Design Approaches that Address Student Voice and Choice’ comprised two online synchronous sessions and an asynchronous learning segment. Using case studies, history teachers explored the practical approaches towards ‘doing’ Differentiated Instructions (DI) well using a range of technological tools.

**Synchronous Workshop (Part 1) on 16 February 2022**

During the workshop, Mr Miller shared his considerations for designing inclusive and motivating student-centred lessons in a collaborative environment, and he provided a case study for the various groups to apply the DI strategies.

Next, Mr Miller shared how he had used the tools such as Flipgrid, Question Matrix, and HyperRubrics, in his classroom to give his students ‘voice’ and ‘choice’. Using the station rotation format, the workshop participants were given the autonomy to select two of the three tools that they would like to explore based on either the MOE Upper or Lower Secondary syllabus.

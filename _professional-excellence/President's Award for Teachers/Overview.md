### President’s Award for Teachers (PAT)

The President’s Award for Teachers (PAT) recognises excellent educators for their role in moulding the future of our nation.

In recognition of their inspiration to their students and peers, eight outstanding educators received the PAT 2022 from President Halimah Yacob during the Teachers’ Day Reception held at the Istana on Thursday, 1 September 2022. They constantly adopt innovative approaches in their lessons, and are lifelong learners and mentors to their peers. They reach out to their students, affirm their strengths and efforts, and encourage them to pursue their dreams. Through their words and deeds, these educators are an inspiration to their students and colleagues.

<p>
Critical Inquiry in Professional Development is a systematic approach that teachers adopt to reflect on and improve their practice. Critical Inquiry involves an area of inquiry in the classroom with the aim to refine classroom practices and enhance student learning. During the critical inquiry process, teachers identify learning needs and gaps, generate questions, develop ideas, examine strategies, gather evidence, and analyse data, to improve their classroom teaching and learning.

develop a systematic approach in gathering information and analysis;  <br><br>

engage in reflective practice, which integrates the 3 aspects of teaching – Theory, Research and Practice; and most importantly,  <br><br>

refine and improve our classroom practices, and enhance your students’ learning!<br>

To nurture such a culture, situating critical inquiry in <a href="https://staging.d2dfevnwgxersp.amplifyapp.com/professional-excellence/Professional-Learning-Groups/about-us/">professional learning communities</a> within schools is a first step.<Br><br>

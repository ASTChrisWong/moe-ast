AST designs and organises a series of courses to equip teachers with the knowledge and skills in conducting critical inquiry for their professional development. Sign up for a course of your choice through [OPAL2.0](http://www.opal2.moe.edu.sg/).

As reflective practitioners, teachers in professional learning communities can make use of various critical inquiry methods to systematically investigate their instructional practices. This will help them reflect upon and refine their classroom practices collaboratively, to continually improve student learning.

### Outstanding Youth in Education Award (OYEA)

The OYEA is a national award that recognises and honours the achievements of young educators who have shown admirable passion for teaching, and commitment to inspiring and nurturing their students. Launched in 1999, it seeks to recognise excellent younger teachers for their youthful idealism, enthusiasm, energy and active involvement in the development of youth beyond the formal curriculum.
